# `getStaticPaths`

getStaticPaths is a Next.js function that allows you to pre-render pages during the build process. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the server.

To use getStaticPaths, you need to export a function with the same name from a page that uses dynamic routes. The function must return an object with two properties:

* `paths`: An array of paths that you want to pre-render.
* `fallback`: A boolean value that determines what happens if a path is not found in the `paths` array. If `fallback` is true, Next.js will render a fallback page. If `fallback` is false, Next.js will return a 404 error.

Here is an example of how to use getStaticPaths:

```
import React from 'react';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <h1>This is the home page</h1>
  );
}

export function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = [
    {
      path: '/',
    },
    {
      path: '/about',
    },
  ];

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

This function will pre-render the pages at `/` and `/about`. If the user visits either of these pages, the page will be served from cache and the server will not need to be hit.

getStaticPaths is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of your Next.js application. By pre-rendering pages during the build process, you can reduce the number of requests that need to be made to the server, which can improve the overall user experience.

## The `fallback` option

The fallback option in Next.js's `getStaticPaths` function allows you to specify what should happen when a path is requested that does not have a pre-generated page. There are two possible values for the fallback option:

* `false`: This will cause Next.js to return a 404 error.
* `true`: This will cause Next.js to return a temporary page while the page is being generated in the background.

The fallback option can be used to improve the user experience when visiting a page that has not yet been generated. By returning a temporary page, users can see that the page is loading and will not be left waiting for a 404 error to appear.

Here is an example of how to use the fallback option in `getStaticPaths`:

```js
const getStaticPaths = () => {
  const paths = [
    {
      path: "/about",
      component: AboutPage,
    },
    {
      path: "/contact",
      component: ContactPage,
    },
  ];

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: true,
  };
};
```

In this example, we are returning two paths: `/about` and `/contact`. We are also setting the fallback option to `true`. This means that if a user visits a path that is not listed in `paths`, Next.js will return a temporary page while the page is being generated in the background.

The fallback option can be used in a variety of situations. For example, you might use it to:

* Generate pages on demand: If you have a large number of pages, you might not want to generate them all at build time. Instead, you can use the fallback option to generate pages on demand when they are first requested.
* Improve the user experience: The fallback option can be used to improve the user experience when visiting a page that has not yet been generated. By returning a temporary page, users can see that the page is loading and will not be left waiting for a 404 error to appear.
* Handle errors: The fallback option can be used to handle errors that occur when generating a page. For example, if an error occurs while fetching data from a database, you can use the fallback option to return a temporary page with an error message.

The fallback option is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance and user experience of your Next.js application.
