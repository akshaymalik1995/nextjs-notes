# getStaticPaths

getStaticPaths is a Next.js function that allows you to pre-render pages during the build process. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the server.

To use getStaticPaths, you need to export a function with the same name from a page that uses dynamic routes. The function must return an object with two properties:

* `paths`: An array of paths that you want to pre-render.
* `fallback`: A boolean value that determines what happens if a path is not found in the `paths` array. If `fallback` is true, Next.js will render a fallback page. If `fallback` is false, Next.js will return a 404 error.

Here is an example of how to use getStaticPaths:

```
import React from 'react';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <h1>This is the home page</h1>
  );
}

export function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = [
    {
      path: '/',
    },
    {
      path: '/about',
    },
  ];

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

This function will pre-render the pages at `/` and `/about`. If the user visits either of these pages, the page will be served from cache and the server will not need to be hit.

getStaticPaths is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of your Next.js application. By pre-rendering pages during the build process, you can reduce the number of requests that need to be made to the server, which can improve the overall user experience.
