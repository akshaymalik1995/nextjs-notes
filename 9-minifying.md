# What is Minifying?

Developers write code that is optimized for human readability. This code might contain extra information that is not necessary for the code to run, such as comments, spaces, indents, and multiple lines.

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary code formatting and comments without changing the code’s functionality. The goal is to improve the application’s performance by decreasing file sizes.

In Next.js, JavaScript and CSS files are automatically minified for production.
