File-based routing is a routing system in Next.js that uses the file system to define routes. In file-based routing, each file in the `pages` directory can be a route. The name of the file is used to define the route path. For example, a file named `index.js` will be a route at `/`.

To use file-based routing, you need to create a file in the `pages` directory with the name of the route you want to create. The file should contain a React component that will be rendered for that route. For example, to create a route at `/about`, you would create a file named `about.js` in the `pages` directory and add the following code to it:

```js
const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
```

Once you have created the file, you can access the route by navigating to the corresponding URL in your browser. For example, to navigate to the about page, you would navigate to `/about` in your browser.

File-based routing is a simple and easy way to create routes in Next.js. It is a good choice for small projects or projects where you do not need complex routing rules.
