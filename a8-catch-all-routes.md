In Next.js, a catch-all route refers to a dynamic routing pattern that allows you to match and handle multiple dynamic routes using a single page or API endpoint. It is denoted by using square brackets ([]) in the file name of a page or API route.

For example, if you have a file named `[...slug].js` in the pages directory, it will match any route that starts with the specified path segment followed by one or more segments. The segments will be available as an array parameter called `slug` in the page or API route.

Here's an example to illustrate how catch-all routes work:

1. File: `[...slug].js`
   ```javascript
   import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

   function MyPage() {
     const router = useRouter();
     const { slug } = router.query;

     return <div>Slug: {slug.join('/')}</div>;
   }

   export default MyPage;
   ```

2. URL: `/products/laptops/dell-xps-13`
   - The file `[...slug].js` will match this URL.
   - The `slug` parameter in the page will be `['products', 'laptops', 'dell-xps-13']`.
   - The rendered page will display: "Slug: products/laptops/dell-xps-13".

By using catch-all routes, you can create dynamic pages or API endpoints that can handle a wide range of URLs and adapt their behavior based on the provided segments.
