# Nextjs Project Setup

To start a Next.js project, you can use the `create-next-app` command. This command will create a new project directory with all the necessary files and dependencies.

To use the `create-next-app` command, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

```
npx create-next-app my-app
```

This command will create a new directory named `my-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies. You can then start the development server by running the following command:

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on port 3000. You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your new Next.js project.
